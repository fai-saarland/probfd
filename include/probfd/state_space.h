/**
 * @brief An interface representing a Markov Decision Process (MDP) without
 * objective function.
 *
 * This interface has four responsibilities:
 * 1. The translation between states and state IDs. While states can be large
 * explicit representations, StateIDs are cheap to store and copy.
 * 2. The computation of the set of actions applicable in a state.
 * 3. The computation of the transitions of the MDP.
 *
 * @tparam State - The state type of the MDP.
 * @tparam Action - The action type of the MDP.
 *
 * @todo One could also parameterize this interface with a custom ID type for
 * states. This would make it possible to specify Fast Downward's StateID type
 * as well, and the hacked conversion to our StateID type could be removed.
 * It would also enable optimizations if conversion is not needed because the
 * State type is already cheap to copy, e.g. the StateRank type in the PDB
 * implementation. In that case, the state ID conversion functions could be
 * declared inline as the identity function and compilers could optimize out
 * the call while the programming abstraction remains. The major downside of
 * this approach is that the StateID type is used frequently in the code base,
 * so the codebase might become even more infested with templates.
